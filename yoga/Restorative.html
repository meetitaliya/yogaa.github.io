                <h1>What is restorative yoga?  </h1>

                <p>"In restorative yoga, you'll typically practice just a few restful postures that are meant to slow your body down and create a state of overall calm and relaxation," says class instructor and yoga teacher Caley Alyssa in mbg's 28 Days to Yoga Bliss class.</p>
                <p>So where did this style of yoga come from? According to Restorative Yoga for Life by Gail Boorstein Grossman, restorative yoga poses originated from master yoga teacher B.K.S. Iyengar, who began to include props in his yoga sessions "so that poses could be modified and practiced without strain." </p>

                <p>Today, restorative yoga still uses a generous number of props (like bolsters, blankets, and blocks) to perform poses that are held for long periods of time (think several minutes), explains Lisa Maria, RYT-200, national workshop director at YogaWorks and certified yoga instructor. This style of yoga isn't about tackling physically demanding poses but instead focuses on total relaxation of the body and the mind. </p>
                <p>"The thing that's so great about [restorative yoga] is that you have zero muscular engagement, so your muscles can really soften," says Maria. The class might also include nonphysical elements, like visualization exercises, poetry readings, and breathwork, she adds.</p>
                <h1>Benefits of restorative yoga. </h1>
                <p>"One of the best practices for healing and relaxing your body is restorative yoga," Alyssa mentions in mbg's 28 Days to Yoga Bliss class. But beyond deep relaxation, what can restorative yoga actually do for you and your health? There have been a number of studies that explore this topic. Some of those findings suggest that restorative yoga may: </p>
                <h1>What is a restorative yoga class like?</h1>
                <p>While there is no set structure for class, "just like in other [yoga] classes, there are twists, there are forward bends, there are backbends," explains Maria. The difference is that in restorative yoga, you'll hold these poses for much longer than usual, likely with the aid of props.</p>
                <p>You might do twists and backbends over a pillow or bolster, for example. You could also find yourself lying on your back with a cylindrical bolster under your knees, sandbags on your palms, and a blanket over the body. As mentioned, your class may include nonphysical elements as well. You can expect to end class in a savasana-style pose, says Maria.</p>
                <p>And in terms of what you need to bring? Maria suggests wearing comfortable clothes and perhaps bringing a few warmer items—like cozy sweatpants and warm socks—in case you get cold (which could happen since you won't be generating much body heat). You may also want to bring something to cover your eyes—like a lightweight eye pillow, a washcloth, or even a T-shirt—as this can help you further relax. You can place this over your eyes during really any portion of class, she says. </p>
