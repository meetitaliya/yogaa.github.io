                <h1>Bhujangasana – Cobra Pose</h1>
                <img src="img/h5.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>This asana is quite easy when it comes to learning it. Just lie down on the belly and place the face in a manner that chin touches the ground. Place the hands close to the body while the palms are touching the floor. Keep the legs as straight as you can and press your palms as firm as you can against the floor. While inhaling, straighten the arms and lift your chest followed by your upper back. It is an essential asana when it comes to the strengthening of back muscles, arms and shoulders. It is derived from Cobra the snake, and asana, the pose. Perform this posture to stimulate the growth of the body.</p>
