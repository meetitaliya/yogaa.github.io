                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Sun salutation, also known as Surya Namaskar, is an ancient method consisting of a sequence of yoga
                    asanas or positions performed to reverence the sun. The sun has always been revered throughout human
                    history, and in Hindu mythology, the Sun-God, or Surya, is a symbol of good health and eternal life.
                    According to the Rig Veda, the sun is the soul of both moving and non-moving entities.

                    Surya Namaskar steps are divided into twelve postures or asanas performed one after the other in
                    order. The asanas stretch the body while contracting and extending the chest alternately to control
                    respiration. Surya Namaskar Yoga improves the flexibility of the spine and joints and the body's
                    ability to shed excess fat when practised regularly. It also helps warm up the body in preparation
                    for various asanas and yoga activities.

                    Although there are many versions of the Surya Namaskar poses today, the most common ones are:</p>

                <h1>Surya Namaskar: Mythology And Ancient Origins</h1>
                <p>Surya Namaskar is one of the most significant asanas or pre asanas in yoga practice. Worshipping or
                    offering pranams to the Sun-God brings happiness, and it also has a long history that spans the
                    globe. Sun worship was considered Pagan by Abrahamic faiths. The worship of the Sun-God was
                    significant in most civilisations discovered thus far, and few did not do so. Although their worship
                    methods differed, all of these civilisations recognised the sun as the ruler, the holy monarch, of
                    the above and below realms. Sun worship was precise and organised in certain cultures, while it was
                    done using solar imagery in others.

                    The worship of the Sun-God is also referenced in ancient Egyptian history when the Sun God was known
                    as "Re." According to their beliefs, the sun begins his trip across the celestial ocean as a child
                    God Kheper, then becomes a full-grown Sun, "Re," in the afternoon, and finally becomes Atum in the
                    evening.

                    Before the arrival of Christianity, the Sun played a significant role in all ancient Mexican and
                    Peruvian rites. Their monarchs were thought to be Sun God's embodiment. The goddess "Amaterasu," who
                    was linked to the Sun God, was also worshipped by the Japanese.


                    The Sun Dance of North America, which was legally prohibited in America in the early nineteenth
                    century, is the most renowned recent example of solar worship.</p>
                <h1>Surya Namaskar Yoga Importance</h1>
                <p>The ultimate asana for strengthening the back and muscles of the body is Surya Namaskar. Surya
                    Namaskar yoga has several benefits: it is a comprehensive workout for the entire physical system
                    that can be done without any equipment. It's also a fantastic method to get away from life's tedious
                    and exhausting everyday routines.

                    Ancient Indian sages venerated Surya Namaskar because of its effect on the many forces that regulate
                    our bodily and mental well-being. The solar plexus, a network of radiating nerves located in the pit
                    of the stomach, is supposed to be linked to the Sun. As a result, consistent Surya Namaskar practice
                    increases the size of the solar plexus, which improves creativity, intuition, confidence,
                    decision-making ability, and leadership.

                    Although there is no set time of day when Surya Namaskar should be performed, it is generally done
                    at sunrise. That is when the sun's rays are most appropriate and advantageous to the body's
                    revitalisation and rejuvenation. It can also be done after a long day to unwind and relax.</p>
