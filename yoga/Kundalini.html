                <h1>What is Kundalini yoga? </h1>
                <img src="img/y4.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>First introduced to the western world in the late 70s by Yogi Bhajan, Kundalini yoga is a combination
                    of breath, movement, and sound. It derives from the Sanskrit word kundal, which translates to
                    “coiled energy.” The idea is that we all have energy gathered at the base of our spine and, through
                    the practice of Kundalini, we bring that energy up our spine through the seven chakras, and out the
                    crown of our head.</p>
                <p>“The process of growth through Kundalini Yoga is a natural unfolding of your own nature,” Yogi Bhajan
                    has said. “Like a snake, you will need to shed old skins to be more of who you are.” The ultimate
                    goal of Kundalini is to increase your self-awareness by silencing your mind and unblocking your
                    chakras so that your vital energy can flow freely.</p>
                <p>"The practice of kundalini is filled with really challenging breath exercises coupled with asanas and
                    meditation," says yoga instructor Caley Alyssa in our 28 Days To Yoga Bliss class. "These are often
                    practiced in repetition for a pretty lengthy period of time and move a lot of energy around in your
                    body."</p>
                <p>There's a reason why the practice has gained popularity only recently: The ancient teachings of
                    Kundalini yoga were kept secret for a very long time, only taught to royalty and nobility for
                    thousands of years until Bhajan brought it to the West in the late 1960s and began to teach it
                    publicly.</p>
                <h1>What are the health benefits? </h1>
                <p>There are a lot of reasons why people choose to practice Kundalini—like its effect on both your
                    physical and psychological well-being. Below are some of the most popular health benefits of
                    Kundalini, including a faster metabolism, better mood, and lowered stress levels.</p>
                <h3>2.Improves your mood</h3>
                <p>That “high” you get after a sweaty yoga class is a real thing—research has found that regularly
                    practicing Kundalini yoga increases the production of serotonin (the happy hormone) in your brain.
                </p>
                <h3>Lowers your blood pressure and heart rate</h3>
                <p>Studies have repeatedly shown that Kundalini yoga—specifically the deep breathing techniques used
                    during it—can decrease the risk of hypertension. Long, slow breaths calm your autonomic nervous
                    system and reduce stress, thus lowering both your blood pressure and pulse rate.</p>
                <h3>Enhances your memory and focus</h3>
                <p>According to research, Kundalini yoga can impact cognitive functioning1, boosting both your
                    concentration and memory. Even the Alzheimer’s Research and Prevention Foundation recommends a
                    Kundalini kriya for improving memory retention. </p>
                <h3>Boosts your metabolism and digestive system</h3>
                <p>Through the combination of breath and postures, Kundalini yoga is focused on strengthening your core
                    and diaphragm. This in turn improves your digestion and has been shown by researchers to speed up
                    metabolism2 (meaning your body processes energy more efficiently).</p>
                <h1>How to practice</h1>
                <p>A typical Kundalini yoga class is comprised of three parts: an opening chant (known as “tuning in”)
                    followed by a brief warm-up for your spine, a kriya (which is a sequence of postures paired with
                    breathing techniques), and a closing meditation or song.</p>

                <p>Each kriya—which is Sanskrit for “action”—pairs a physical pose with a breath or meditation. These
                    poses can be anything you choose based on the part of your body that you want to focus on, like
                    cobra pose for your spine or warrior for your legs and glutes. </p>
                <p>While different kriyas use different breaths, one of the most popular breathing techniques is Breath
                    of Fire, which consists of short, quick breaths (almost like a dog panting). To do Breath of Fire,
                    seal your lips and breathe in and out of your nose at a rate of about two to three breaths per
                    second. As you breathe, expel the air in powerful spurts to engage your core.</p>
                <p>Chanting and singing are also key components of Kundalini yoga. There are endless mantras and songs
                    that you can recite during your practice but most classes start with the Adi Mantra, which means “I
                    bow to the subtle divine wisdom, the divine teacher within.” Another common chant you’ll hear in a
                    Kundalini class is Sat Nam, which means “I am truth.”</p>
                <p>You can also expect a meditation-heavy class. Each set during Kundalini yoga has different poses that
                    involve movement, breathing techniques, mindfulness, and a mantra. Between postures, you’ll have a
                    minute or two to relax and focus inward. After the entire set, there’s a relaxation followed by a
                    meditation, then a mantra before class closes.</p>
                <P>Bonus: While you don’t have to wear head-to-toe white, it is common in Kundalini. That’s because the
                    color white is thought to ward off negative energy and extend your own aura. Teachers will often
                    also wear a white head covering, such as a hat, scarf, or turban, to contain the energy within the
                    body.</P>
