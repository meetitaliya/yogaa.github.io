                <h1>What is Ashtanga yoga? </h1>
                <img src="img/y5.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>Developed by the late Pattabhi Jois, Ashtanga is a vigorous style of yoga that incorporates set
                    sequences or series of postures where the breath is linked with movement, according to Yoga
                    Medicine® Therapeutic Specialist Diane Malaspina, Ph.D.
                <p>There are six levels of sequences or series in Ashtanga yoga, including the Primary Series, Secondary
                    Series, and four levels of Advanced Series. A newcomer would typically begin with the Primary Series
                    and progress once they've memorized and mastered the sequence.</p>
                <p>The energetic nature of all of the series leads to a cleansing of the body through heat, which
                    Malaspina says enhances circulation, improves joint pain, carries impurities away from the body, and
                    builds strength. "As students progress through the series, strength and grace are cultivated, and
                    breathing becomes more even, which purifies the nervous system," she says.</p>
                <p>The Ashtanga system emphasizes the Eight Limbs of Yoga1 as outlined in the Yoga Sutras, which
                    Malaspina says serves as practices for living a meaningful life. This system inspires followers to
                    adopt a daily practice of yoga. </p>
                <h1>What are the health benefits? </h1>
                <p>Ashtanga yoga is known for its ability to help students develop a routine of self-discipline and,
                    eventually, their own daily practice. Additionally, many people choose Ashtanga for its physically
                    demanding series of poses as well as the numerous health benefits that come from practicing this
                    method of yoga. Here are six health benefits worth noting: </p>
                <h3>1.Improves breathing technique.</h3>
                <p>In Ashtanga, the postures are strung together with a breathing technique called ujjayi breathing—a
                    textured audible inhale and exhale through the nose, says registered yoga teacher, and MINDBODY
                    holistic wellness expert Christa Quattrocchi. Since each pose is held for five full breaths,
                    Ashtanga yoga allows you to develop a deep level of awareness over your breathing. </p>
                <h3>2.Establishes mental strength.</h3>
                <p>Ashtanga is challenging, both physically and mentally. With the physical challenge of deep stretches,
                    core strengthening, and inverted postures, Quattrocchi says the practice pushes you beyond your
                    boundaries and into a space of mental perseverance. "It constantly reminds you that you are capable
                    of much more than you realize," she says.</p>
                <h3>3.Boosts psychological well-being.</h3>
                <p>Researchers have found that Ashtanga yoga can be used as an intervention to improve psychological
                    well-being. According to a 2017 study published in Mindfulness, participants who took Ashtanga yoga
                    classes two times a week for nine weeks reported significant improvements in both depression and
                    anxiety symptoms2.</p>
                <h3>4.Calms the nervous system.</h3>
                <p>"Ashtanga is a moving meditation focused on breath and precision," says Quattrocchi. The rigorous
                    sequence ends with savasana, or corpse pose, where your body can integrate all of the physical and
                    mental feats. It's here, she says, that the body can easily transition into "rest and digest" mode
                    as the mind is quiet, and the body is prepared for stillness.</p>
                <h3>5.May help with bone formation.</h3>
                <p>A 2015 randomized controlled study published in the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine found that
                    an eight-month practice of performing two sessions a week of Ashtanga-based yoga had a small
                    positive effect on bone formation3 in middle-age, premenopausal women.</p>
                <h3>6.Reduces lower back pain.</h3>
                <p>The Ashtanga Primary Series includes postures that stretch and strengthen lower back muscles. And
                    since the same poses are executed each time you step onto the mat, Quattrocchi says you will
                    continue to flex (and strengthen) these muscles, which may help reduce low-back pain.</p>
                <h1>How to practice. </h1>
                <p>To practice this style of yoga, Quattrocchi says you will first follow the Primary Series, which is
                    comprised of four parts: sun salutations, a standing sequence, a backhanding sequence, and a
                    finishing sequence. The poses are always practiced in this order and held for five full breaths.
                </p>
                <p>During a class, Malaspina says a teacher will lead you through the sequences and provide guidance on
                    alignment and offer hands-on assistance. After you memorize the sequence, you can join a
                    Mysore-style class where you practice in the same room with other students but without a teacher
                    leading—although, they may be present to offer encouragement. </p>
                <p>To unify body, mind, and spirit, Ashtanga yogis integrate all three components of the practice,
                    including vinyasa, or movement linked with breath; bandhas, or energetic locks that direct the
                    energy of the subtle body; and drishti, a one-pointed focus, which Malaspina says centers the mind.
                </p>
                <p>The system is a highly structured style of yoga, and as you progress, the poses become more
                    challenging. That's why Malaspina says it's important to let instructors know about any physical
                    limitations and to listen to your body. "Ask for modifications if you feel pain in any pose, and
                    consider taking classes that are teacher-led prior to taking Mysore classes," she says</p>
                </p>
                <h1>Who is Ashtanga good for?</h1>
                <p>If you're looking to build strength and flexibility along with physical and mental endurance,
                    consider trying Ashtanga yoga. However, since it is a very physically demanding sequence of poses,
                    it may not be a great fit for yoga beginners. </p>
                <p>That said, if you're eager to get started but you're new to Ashtanga yoga, Malaspina recommends
                    beginning with the Primary Series. "This teacher-led class is a great place for new students since
                    they often find the repetition helpful," she explains. Plus, once you learn the series, you can
                    practice at your own pace, in your own space.</p>
                <p>Additionally, Quattrocchi stresses the importance of being self-motivated and thriving on structure
                    as characteristics that may determine a good fit for Ashtanga yoga. "It requires a great deal of
                    discipline and physical strength, so if you're already active, this is a great way to introduce yoga
                    into your routine," she says. </p>
