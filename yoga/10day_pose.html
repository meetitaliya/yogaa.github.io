                <p>Yoga poses and techniques have been used for centuries as a way to achieve optimal health and
                    well-being. Below are 10 selected from The Ultimate Yogi program, along with descriptions of their
                    therapeutic benefits. Even when you don't have a couple of hours to attend your favorite yoga class,
                    just a few minutes with a couple of postures can be incredibly powerful, especially when combined
                    with breath, intention and presence.</p>
                <h1>Malasana (Yoga Squat)</h1>
                <img src="img/malasana.webp" alt="">
                <p>This pose is a squatting position with toes out, the heels in, and the hands at prayer position in
                    front of the chest. It's great for pregnant women, as it stretches the calves, inner thighs,
                    relieves back ache and opens the pubic symphysis in the the pelvis.</p>
                <h1>Half Moon</h1>
                <img src="img/mala1.webp" alt="">
                <p>in this pose, you balance on the right leg and right hand with the the left leg lifted parallel to
                    the
                    floor and the left arm extended straight up. In order to age gracefully, we must challenge our
                    balance regularly. When in a balancing pose like this, the brain lights up like fireworks. It good
                    for the brain, the mind and the nervous system. </p>
                <h1>Alternate Nostril Breathing</h1>
                <img src="img/Alternate Nostril Breathing.webp" alt="">
                <p>This is a form of yogic breathing that's done in a comfortable seated position that brings
                    equilibrium to the two branches of the autonomic nervous system. It greatly releases stress and
                    anxiety, and also helps to clean the lymphatic system.</p>
                <h1>Gratitude Meditation</h1>
                <img src="img/Gratitude Meditation.webp" alt="">
                <p>This is a universal form of meditation where you focus on all the things you feel grateful for, which
                    is the perfect antidote for depression.</p>
                <h1>Camel Pose</h1>
                <img src="img/Camel Pose.webp" alt="">
                <p>In this pose you stand up on the knees, hips width apart. Both hands rest either on the lower back or
                    heels depending on the student's flexibility. The pose increases lung capacity, and stimulates the
                    adrenal, pituitary, pineal and thyroid glands. </p>
                <h1>Bound Angle</h1>
                <img src="img/Bound Angle.webp" alt="">
                <p>In this pose you sit on the floor with the soles of the feet together, allowing the knees to drop out
                    and toward the floor. The shoulders stack over the hips, and it is optional to lean forward, keeping
                    a straight spine. The pose relieves the symptoms of a woman's menstrual cycle, menopause, and even
                    prostate disorders by circulating energy through the pelvic organs. </p>
                <h1>Warrior 1</h1>
                <img src="img/warrior_1.webp" alt="">
                <p>Standing with the feet at least 4 to 4.5 feet apart, the front toes point forward with the back foot
                    on a slight angle, the feet aligned heel to heel distance. The front knee stacks right above the
                    front ankle, with the front thigh parallel to the floor. Both arms extend overhead as the shoulders,
                    chest, and hips attempt to square forward toward the front of the room. This pose is a wonderful
                    stretch for the "mother of all abdominal muscles," the psoas. Psoas tension is often seen displayed
                    in the body through a tight jaw, grinding of the teeth, and general mouth tension. This pose can
                    help stretch the psoas and bring relief to overall tension in the body</p>
                <h1>Wheel Of Vitality</h1>
                <img src="img/Wheel Of Vitality.webp" alt="">
                <p>Standing with the feet wide apart, turn the heels in and point the toes out. Bending the knees out
                    toward the toes, the students squats toward the floor, keeping the knees properly aligned. With the
                    hands at the heart, a circular tai-chi type movement begins: 1) open the arms out and bring the
                    hands back together at the heart, 2) hands are pressed toward the sky, then back down toward the
                    floor 3) hands sweep down, toward back foot and then make a big circle forward, all the way back
                    around 4) reverse the circular movement the opposite way. Repeat this arm motion three times,
                    maintaining the steady squat the entire time. This movement promotes the cardiovascular system, and
                    the movement of blood through body while improving focus and emphasizing the breath.</p>
                <h1>Half Lord Of The Fishes Pose</h1>
                <img src="img/Half Lord Of The Fishes Pose.webp" alt="">
                <p>Bend the left knee while crossing the right foot over top, with the knee sticking straight up. With
                    the right hand on the floor behind for support, bend the left elbow and place it on the outer right
                    thigh to engage into a deep, thorough twist. Repeat on the other side and make sure that you twist
                    from maximum spinal length. This pose is good for improving digestion by wringing out the digestive
                    organs and system and is a simple twist that can help alleviate back pain by bringing awareness to
                    the low back and helping to unwind muscles of the low back region.</p>
                <h1>Forearm Plank</h1>
                <img src="img/Forearm Plank.webp" alt="">
                <p>Think upper push-up, but on your forearms. With the elbows right under the shoulders and the palms
                    flat to the floor, the back toes tuck so the body is in one line of energy from the crown of the
                    head all the way through the heels. This is a wonderful pose that uses the students' own body weight
                    to create strength in the shoulders and the core muscles. Using your own body weight in yoga to
                    create strength helps to keep the skeletal system strong and helps to prevent osteoporosis. </p>
