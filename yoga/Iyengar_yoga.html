                <h1>First, what is Iyengar yoga? </h1>
                <img src="img/y3.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Iyengar is a form of hatha yoga that focuses on proper alignment and precise technique. Through
                    slower movements and an emphasis on quality over quantity, Iyengar yoga combines asanas (poses) and
                    pranayama (breath) to build strength, stamina, and flexibility.</p>
                <p>Founded by B.K.S. Iyengar in the 1960s (and later popularized with his book, Light on Yoga), Iyengar
                    yoga is based on the yoga sutras and works to strengthen the connection between body and mind. "Yoga
                    teaches us to cure what need not be endured and endure what cannot be cured," Iyengar once said. He
                    believed that a balanced body led to a balanced mind—hence Iyengar yoga's unique blend of both
                    meditation and movement.</p>
                <br />
                <h1>What are the health benefits? </h1>
                <p>There are a lot of reasons people choose to practice Iyengar yoga, including its many physical,
                    mental, and psychological health benefits. These are seven of the most common ones as shown by
                    scientific research:</p>
                <h3>1.Builds strength.</h3>
                <p>Holding each pose for longer (often upward of a minute) will strengthen and tone your muscles.
                    Standing postures, in particular—like tree pose or warrior 2—can help increase the strength of your
                    lower body and core.</p>
                <h3>2.Increases flexibility.</h3>
                <p>Yoga, in general, is known for improving flexibility—and Iyengar is no exception. A study found that
                    after just six weeks of practicing Iyengar, participants saw a significant increase in their spine
                    and hamstring flexibility1. </p>
                <h3>3.Improves posture.</h3>
                <p>With its strong focus on alignment, a regular Iyengar practice can help you develop better posture.
                    It focuses on correcting weaker or stiffer areas of your body, especially in your neck and back.
                </p>
                <h3>4.Boosts energy levels.</h3>
                <p>One study—which analyzed the effects of Iyengar on patients with chronic respiratory disease—revealed
                    that by practicing yoga, the patients noticed a marked decrease in their fatigue2. This could be due
                    to the release of endorphins or increased blood flow to your brain.</p>
                <h3>5.Decreases stress and anxiety.</h3>
                <p>Iyengar yoga increases the production of a mood-boosting chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid
                    (GABA) in your brain, a recent study discovered. Participants in the study reported lower levels of
                    anxiety and better overall well-being after three months of Iyengar yoga.</p>
                <h3>6.Reduces chronic pain.</h3>
                <p>A lot of chronic pain is caused by improper alignment, whether it's slouching or slumping. Iyengar
                    realigns your body (especially in your neck, back, and spine) which, according to research, can
                    dramatically reduce aches and pains.</p>
                <h3>7.Lowers blood pressure.</h3>
                <p>Scientists have found that Iyengar yoga triggers the relaxation response in your body3 (as opposed to
                    the fight-or-flight response). This both slows your heart rate and decreases your blood pressure,
                    both of which can keep your heart healthy and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>
                <h1>How to practice.</h1>
                <p>To practice this style of yoga at home, you'll first need to create a sequence using the over 200
                    different poses and 14 breathing techniques that exist in Iyengar. While you can mix and match the
                    poses as you choose, Iyengar yoga typically starts with a meditative warm-up, followed by standing
                    postures, and then ending with restorative, supine poses.</p>
                <p>Many Iyengar classes also have a "peak pose" that dictates which postures you choose to practice
                    leading up to it. For example, if your peak pose is eagle pose, your sequence may include more
                    one-legged balancing postures to prep your body whereas if your peak pose is king pigeon, you'll
                    want to include more hip-openers and backbends.</p>
                <p>Many Iyengar classes also have a "peak pose" that dictates which postures you choose to practice
                    leading up to it. For example, if your peak pose is eagle pose, your sequence may include more
                    one-legged balancing postures to prep your body whereas if your peak pose is king pigeon, you'll
                    want to include more hip-openers and backbends.</p>
                <p>Unlike vinyasa styles of yoga, in Iyengar, you won't flow through poses breath to movement—instead,
                    you'll hold them for an extended period of time. This gives you the chance to get into the correct
                    alignment and then move deeper into each pose.</p>
                <p>Props are also incredibly common in an Iyengar class, as they make poses more accessible for
                    beginners. You can use blocks, straps, bolsters, and blankets to help you get into proper alignment.
                </p>
                <p>Another pro tip: There are plenty of resources for practicing Iyengar at home. However, if you've
                    never done Iyengar yoga before, it's worth taking a class at a studio first. All Iyengar teachers
                    must undergo rigorous training and they'll be able to give you guidance and adjustments that you
                    won't get in a home practice.</p>
                <h1>Who is it good for? </h1>
                <p>Because it was founded on the belief that yoga should be for everyone, Iyengar yoga is great for
                    anyone of any age or skill level. Plus, of all the different styles, Iyengar is most ideal for
                    people who like variety in their practice, as each class is different (unlike Bikram or Ashtanga,
                    for instance, which have set sequences).</p>
                <p>Iyengar is also beneficial for anyone with injuries or chronic pain, thanks to its slower movements
                    and attention to form and alignment.</p>
