                <h1>I became physically and mentally sharper.</h1>
                <img src="img/y6.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>Yes, sometimes class was exhausting. Bikram is not your average workout! The class itself is an hour
                    and a half, and when I combined that with getting to and from the studio and showering, I had taken
                    a whopping 2 to 3 hours out of my day.</p>
                <p>On two occasions I missed class, which meant two days of doubles. On these days, it took all my
                    willpower to muster up the energy to head back to the studio after already having given it my all.
                    But no matter how much I wanted to slack off during class, the stamina and grit I’d developed by
                    going every day got the better of me, and I kept going back for more.</p>
                <p>The further along I got in the challenge, the more productive I became. My creativity increased, and
                    I became one of the growing statistics backing up all that the research on the mental health
                    benefits of yoga.</p>
                <h1>My emotions ran wild.</h1>
                <p>Yoga can bring up a lot of emotions, especially during heart- or chest-opening poses, and the intense
                    heat in a Bikram class can intensify this even more. I had my good days and my bad days, but Week 2
                    was the most intense.</p>
                <p>I cried during class about a fight I’d had with my mom years earlier. I cried even more after another
                    class when I lost my credit card (and sent my boyfriend out to find it in the middle of a chilly
                    Chicago evening). And when the pigeon living beside our apartment hatched two little baby pigeons, I
                    cried tears of joy—hysterically, of course. I realized how great it is to let go of your feelings,
                    though, or succumb to them.</p>
                <h1>Yes, I lost weight.</h1>
                <p>I didn't do the challenge to lose weight, but I inadvertently did. Ninety minutes of sweating and a
                    series of cardio-based asanas will do that. I was regular as clockwork and my normally prominent
                    sweet tooth vanished.</p>
                <p>Upping my water intake was a challenge, but I wanted to make sure I didn’t dehydrate my body. I took
                    one to two electrolyte drink tabs every day, replenishing any lost sodium, potassium, magnesium, and
                    calcium levels in the process.</p>
                <p>My flexibility took me to new places, which made me more confident overall. I even began taking the
                    advanced class, which I never thought I’d get to do. I was stretching muscles I had no idea even
                    existed!</p>
