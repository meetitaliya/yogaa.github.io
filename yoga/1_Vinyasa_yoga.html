                <h1>What is vinyasa yoga? </h1>
                "Vinyasa yoga has come to mean poses linked together by the breath," explains Lisa Maria, RYT-200,
                national workshop director at YogaWorks and certified yoga instructor. That means all movements in a
                vinyasa class are coordinated with your breathing, and there's no break in between poses. Instead,
                "you're just dynamically moving from one to the next," Maria says.<br /><br />
                Tara Stiles, mbg collective member and founder of Strala Yoga agrees. "Allow your body to move along
                with the ride of your breath," she says in mbg's Complete Guide to Yoga class. "So your inhale is
                literally lifting you and opening you into movement, and your exhale is literally twisting you or moving
                you a little farther along, whatever the movement is."<br />
                <br />This dynamic movement can flow at a rapid paceâ€”or it can be really slow. Whatever the speed, all
                vinyasa classes share "that element of moving dynamically with the breath," says Stiles. </p>

                <h1>What to expect in a vinyasa yoga class.</h1>

                <p>All vinyasa classes will probably start with an intention-setting phase and end in final relaxation.
                    But in between, the format, pace, and other aspects will deviate from class to class. <br />
                    <br />
                    In some vinyasa classes, the teacher might call out poses with the expectation that students will
                    know how to do them. In other vinyasa classes, like in alignment-based vinyasa classes, the teachers
                    will provide more instructions on how to perform postures. There are also vinyasa classes that
                    combine vinyasa with other types of yoga, like yin or restorative, and some vinyasa studios that are
                    heated, says Maria.<br /><br />
                    As you move through your vinyasa class, don't push yourself into poses you don't know. If all of
                    your classmates are busting out headstands, for example, and you've never done one before, now is
                    not the first time to try.<br /><br />
                    Instead, respect your current level, and if you need to take a breather, do so without worry. "It's
                    totally acceptable to take a break," says Maria. "It's respected; it shows that somebody is taking
                    care of themselves."

                <h1>Types of vinyasa poses (asanas).</h1>
                <p>Typically, vinyasa classes will incorporate a variety of postures, or asanas. Think standing, seated and supine poses, twists, balancing poses, forward folds, inversions, and backbends.</p>
           
                <br/>
                <h3>Plank, chaturanga</h3>
                <img src="img/Plank_chaturanga.webp" alt="">
                <h3>Downward-facing dog, one-legged dog, knee to nose</h3><br/>

                <img src="img/1type1.webp" alt=""><br/>

                <h3> Chair pose, boat pose </h3><br/>
                <img src="img/Chair_pose_boat_pose.webp" alt="">
                <br/>
                <p>Also typical: Most classes will build toward a "peak pose" using a sequence of movements that progressively open the body, explains Maria (think crow pose or headstand).</p><br/>
                During your vinyasa class, you might hear the teacher say the word "vinyasa," which generally cues people to perform a repetitive sun salutation sequence that starts with a chaturanga and ends in a downward-facing dog. If this happens and you're confused, simply follow along as best you can, Maria suggests. Or you can use this time to do your own thing entirely, like hold a plank, move to downward dog, or rest in child's pose.
