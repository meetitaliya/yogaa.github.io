                <h1>What is hatha yoga? </h1>
                <p>Traditionally, hatha yoga is a catchall term for any type of yoga that pairs poses ("asanas") with
                    breathing techniques ("pranayama"). Essentially, many of the yoga styles that are popular in the
                    U.S.—like ashtanga, restorative, vinyasa, Iyengar, etc.—fall under the umbrella of hatha. </p>
                <p>At the same time, the term "hatha" has also evolved in the U.S. to describe a particular type of yoga
                    class that's typically slow-paced with a focus on proper alignment, explains Lisa Maria, national
                    workshop director at YogaWorks and certified yoga instructor.</p>
                <P>What's the difference between hatha yoga and vinyasa? Compared to vinyasa classes, which often flow
                    through series of poses at a quick clip, hatha classes typically guide practitioners through
                    postures at a slower pace with more guidance on how to do each pose correctly. </P><br />
                <h1>What are the health benefits? </h1>
                <p>There is some research that focuses specifically on the benefits of hatha, though most of those
                    studies define hatha using the umbrella term (i.e., yoga that combines poses and breathing
                    techniques) rather than specifying it as yoga that's slower-paced and focused on alignment. With
                    that caveat in mind, those studies suggest the broad category of hatha yoga may have a variety of
                    benefits, including: </p><br />
                <h1>What is a hatha yoga class like?</h1>
                <p>The specific format of a hatha yoga session will vary from teacher to teacher and class to class, but
                    usually, classes begin with some sort of "centering exercise," says Maria. This might be in a seated
                    position or on your back and may involve a simple guided meditation, a breathing exercise, or even
                    just a moment of silence, she says. </p>
                <p>From there, the teacher may guide you through a series of movements (think twisting, bending,
                    folding) that build toward a "peak pose." Then, once you achieve that pose, you may do a series of
                    movements to counterbalance some of the previous poses from class, to make sure you leave feeling
                    "balanced," says Maria. Or the class might not be centered on a "peak pose" at all and instead could
                    incorporate a variety of postures like standing poses, reclining poses, balance poses, and twists.
                </p>
                <p>Hatha also focuses on breathwork timed to movements (typically at a slower pace than what you might
                    experience in vinyasa), and classes could include meditation and chanting as well, adds Maria. </p>
                <p>No matter what format your hatha class follows, know that you don't have to do every single pose, and
                    you also don't have to hold poses for as long as the instructor says. It's more than OK to break
                    poses early or even opt out completely and simply sit or stand quietly. "You can take a break
                    anytime you need to," says Maria. </p>
                <p>On the equipment front, a yoga mat is your only must-have. Pro tip: If you buy a brand-new mat, wash
                    it at home first before taking it to class, says Maria. Why? "Most mats have a factory coating on
                    them that's slippery," she explains, which means that if you use it straight from the store (or
                    box), you're likely going to slide around. </p>
                <h1>Hatha is great for beginners and more experienced yogis.</h1>
                <p>Because hatha tends to be a slower form of yoga with a greater emphasis on pose instruction (versus
                    simply performing them), it's a great <a href="11_types_of_yoga.html"> type of yoga</a> for
                    beginners.</p>
                <p>Hatha could also be good for anyone who has a difficult time focusing, adds Maria. "Poses tend to be
                    broken down, so your mind can't wander as much," she explains. "You get brought back to an action
                    over and over again."</p>
                <p>As long as you're in reasonably good physical condition, you should be well-suited for hatha, says
                    Maria. That said, if you have certain health conditions (like a risk of blood clots, a herniated
                    disk, glaucoma, etc.), chat with your doctor before giving hatha a go. </p>
                <p>And if you're pregnant? Know that yoga is generally safe (you can even find specific prenatal yoga
                    classes), but it's probably best to steer clear of certain poses. Again, it's probably a good idea
                    to chat with your doc beforehand to determine what's best for you. </p>
