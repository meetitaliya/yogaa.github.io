                <p>This asana is also known as cat pose which is derived from Marjari meaning cat and asana meaning pose. It is the movement which combines the forward bends along with back arches which gives the back the entire movement that it requires. The vertebrae become more mobile and the movements of thoracic, cervical and lumbar spine release entire tension which is trapped in them. The back and forth movements assist in circulation of spinal fluids which help in strengthening the spine. The limbs muscles are activated and provide the strength and energy in order to work better.</p>
