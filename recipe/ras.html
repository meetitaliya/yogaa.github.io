**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare Mango Puree:**
   - Peel and dice the ripe mangoes.
   - Blend the mango pieces in a blender or food processor to make a smooth puree. Set aside.

2. **Boil Milk:**
   - In a heavy-bottomed pot, bring the milk to a boil over medium heat. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

3. **Add Mango Puree:**
   - Once the milk has boiled and slightly thickened, add the mango puree to the milk. Stir well to combine.

4. **Add Sugar and Flavorings:**
   - Add sugar to the milk and mango mixture. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.
   - Add cardamom powder and the saffron strands soaked in milk. Stir again to mix well.

5. **Simmer and Thicken:**
   - Let the mixture simmer on low heat for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will allow the flavors to meld and the mixture to thicken slightly.

6. **Cool and Serve:**
   - Once the mango ras has reached the desired consistency, remove it from the heat and let it cool to room temperature.
   - Transfer the cooled mango ras to serving bowls.

7. **Garnish:**
   - Garnish the mango ras with chopped nuts like almonds and pistachios.

8. **Chill and Serve:**
   - Refrigerate the mango ras for a couple of hours to chill it before serving. Chilling enhances the flavors and makes it more refreshing.

9. **Serving:**
   - Serve the chilled mango ras as a delightful dessert after meals.

Remember, the sweetness of the mangoes can vary, so adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste. This sweet and creamy Mango Ras is sure to be a hit among your family and friends, especially during mango season or special occasions!
