        <h1>Motichoor Laddu Recipe</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup gram flour (besan)</li>
            <li>1 cup ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
            <li>Chopped nuts (almonds, pistachios) for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, make a batter by combining gram flour and water. The batter should be of pouring consistency.</li>
            <li>Heat ghee in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Hold a perforated ladle (boondi ladle) over the hot ghee and pour a spoonful of batter onto it.</li>
            <li>Tap the ladle gently to let small drops of batter fall into the hot ghee, forming tiny boondis. Fry until they are golden and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain excess oil.</li>
            <li>In a separate pan, prepare sugar syrup by dissolving sugar in water and bringing it to a boil. Add cardamom powder and simmer until it reaches a slightly sticky consistency.</li>
            <li>Add the fried boondis to the sugar syrup and mix gently to coat the boondis evenly. Let them soak for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Allow the mixture to cool down slightly. While it's still warm, shape portions of the mixture into round laddus by pressing and rolling between your palms.</li>
            <li>Garnish the laddus with chopped nuts.</li>
            <li>Let the laddus cool and set completely before storing in an airtight container.</li>
            <li>Your delicious Motichoor Laddus are ready to be enjoyed as a festive treat!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Motichoor Laddus are a popular Indian sweet often served during celebrations and special occasions.</p>
