        <h1>Malpua Recipe</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds (saunf)</li>
            <li>A pinch of cardamom powder</li>
            <li>Chopped nuts (almonds, pistachios) for garnish</li>
            <li>Ghee or oil (for frying)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, milk, and water to make a smooth batter. The batter should be slightly thicker than pancake batter.</li>
            <li>Add fennel seeds and cardamom powder to the batter. Mix well and let the batter rest for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a deep frying pan, heat ghee or oil over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, pour a ladleful of batter into the hot oil to form a round shape. You can make multiple malpuas at a time, depending on the size of your pan.</li>
            <li>Fry the malpuas until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides. Make sure to cook them on medium-low heat to ensure they are cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove the malpuas from the oil and drain excess oil by placing them on paper towels.</li>
            <li>In a separate pan, prepare sugar syrup by dissolving sugar in a little water and bringing it to a boil. Simmer until it reaches a slightly sticky consistency.</li>
            <li>Dip the fried malpuas in the sugar syrup for a few seconds to coat them with the syrup.</li>
            <li>Garnish the malpuas with chopped nuts.</li>
            <li>Your delicious Malpuas are ready to be enjoyed as a sweet treat!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Malpua is a popular Indian dessert often made during festivals and special occasions.</p>
