        <ul>
            <li>1 cup besan (gram flour)</li>
            <li>1 cup ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li>1 cup grated khoya (reduced milk)</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add besan to the ghee and roast it on low to medium heat until it turns golden brown and aromatic. Stir continuously to avoid burning.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and add the grated khoya. Mix well and cook for a few minutes until the khoya melts and blends with the besan.</li>
            <li>Add the powdered sugar and mix until it dissolves and combines with the mixture.</li>
            <li>Add chopped nuts and cardamom powder. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking and stirring until the mixture thickens and leaves the sides of the pan. It should have a glossy texture.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and quickly transfer the mixture to a greased tray or plate. Flatten it using a spatula.</li>
            <li>Let it cool down and set for a few hours.</li>
            <li>Once cooled and set, cut into desired shapes and serve your delicious Gajab Paak!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Gajab Paak is a delightful traditional sweet that can be enjoyed on special occasions and festivals.</p>
