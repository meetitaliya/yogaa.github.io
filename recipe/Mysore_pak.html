        <h1>Mysore Pak Recipe</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup besan (gram flour)</li>
            <li>1 cup ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li>2 cups sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat ghee over low heat.</li>
            <li>Add besan to the ghee and roast it on low to medium heat until it turns aromatic and changes color. Stir continuously to avoid burning.</li>
            <li>In a separate saucepan, combine sugar and water. Heat until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a boil. Keep the sugar syrup warm.</li>
            <li>Add the roasted besan to the warm sugar syrup and mix well to avoid lumps.</li>
            <li>Place the pan back on low heat and start adding ghee, a little at a time, while continuously stirring.</li>
            <li>Keep adding ghee and stirring until the mixture starts leaving the sides of the pan and becomes frothy.</li>
            <li>Grease a plate or tray with ghee and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Once the mixture reaches the desired consistency, pour it into the greased plate and spread it evenly.</li>
            <li>Allow it to cool down for a few minutes, and while it's still warm, cut it into diamond-shaped pieces.</li>
            <li>Let the Mysore Pak cool completely before removing the pieces from the plate.</li>
            <li>Your delicious Mysore Pak is ready to be enjoyed as a classic South Indian sweet!</li>
        </ol>
