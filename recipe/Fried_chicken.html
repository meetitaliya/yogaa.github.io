        <h1>Delicious Fried Chicken Recipe</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken pieces (legs, thighs, wings, or breast)</li>
            <li>Buttermilk</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Paprika</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the buttermilk, salt, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. Add the chicken pieces to the mixture, ensuring they are fully coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, mix the flour, salt, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder to create the coating for the chicken.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade and let any excess liquid drip off.</li>
            <li>Dredge each chicken piece in the seasoned flour mixture, making sure they are well coated. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or pot to about 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>Carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for about 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Use a slotted spoon to remove the fried chicken from the oil and place it on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.</li>
            <li>Let the fried chicken rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
