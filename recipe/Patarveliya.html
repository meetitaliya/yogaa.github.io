        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the colocasia leaves thoroughly and remove the stems.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine gram flour, tamarind pulp, ginger paste, green chili paste, sugar, turmeric powder, red chili powder, cumin-coriander powder, asafoetida, oil, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add water gradually and mix to form a smooth batter with a thick consistency.</li>
            <li>Place a colocasia leaf with the veined side facing up. Spread a thin layer of the prepared batter on the leaf.</li>
            <li>Place another leaf on top, sandwiching the batter between the two leaves. Repeat this process with more leaves and batter.</li>
            <li>Roll the stack of leaves tightly and secure it with kitchen twine or thread.</li>
            <li>Steam the rolled colocasia leaves for about 20-25 minutes, or until the batter is cooked and the leaves are tender.</li>
            <li>Allow the steamed roll to cool down and then slice it into rounds.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pan for frying. Fry the sliced patras until they turn crispy and golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the fried patras from the oil and drain excess oil on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Your delicious and flavorful Patras are ready to be enjoyed as a snack or side dish!</li>
