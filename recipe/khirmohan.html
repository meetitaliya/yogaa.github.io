            <li>1 liter full-fat milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped nuts (cashews, almonds)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li>Saffron strands (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the milk in a heavy-bottomed pan. Once it boils, add lemon juice and stir gently until the milk curdles.</li>
            <li>Strain the curdled milk through a muslin cloth to separate the chenna (curdled milk solids) from the whey.</li>
            <li>Hang the chenna in the cloth for about 30 minutes to drain excess whey.</li>
            <li>Knead the drained chenna gently until it becomes smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Divide the chenna into small portions and shape them into flat discs or patties.</li>
            <li>In a separate pan, dissolve sugar in a little water and bring it to a boil to make a sugar syrup. Add cardamom powder and saffron strands if using.</li>
            <li>Add the chenna patties to the simmering sugar syrup and let them soak for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat ghee in a pan and lightly fry the chopped nuts until golden. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Remove the chenna patties from the sugar syrup and place them on a serving plate.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the remaining sugar syrup over the chenna patties and garnish with fried nuts.</li>
            <li>Your delightful Khir Mohan is ready to be enjoyed as a sweet treat!</li>
        </ol>
