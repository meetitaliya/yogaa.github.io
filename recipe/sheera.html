        <h1>Sheera Recipe</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup semolina (suji/rava)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
            <li>Chopped nuts (cashews, almonds) for garnish</li>
            <li>Raisins for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a deep pan, heat ghee over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add semolina and roast it in the ghee until it turns golden brown and aromatic. Stir continuously to avoid burning.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, heat water and bring it to a boil.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the hot water to the roasted semolina, stirring continuously to prevent lumps from forming.</li>
            <li>Cook the mixture on low heat until the semolina absorbs the water and becomes soft and thick.</li>
            <li>Add sugar and cardamom powder to the mixture. Mix well and continue to cook until the sugar dissolves and the mixture thickens further.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and let the sheera rest for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>While serving, garnish the sheera with chopped nuts and raisins.</li>
            <li>Your flavorful Sheera is ready to be enjoyed as a warm and comforting dessert!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Sheera is a popular Indian sweet made from semolina and is often prepared during festivals and special occasions.</p>
